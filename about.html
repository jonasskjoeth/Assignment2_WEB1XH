            <p class="bodytext">
                I come from a small town in Southern Jutland, Denmark.
                Toftlund has approximately 3.500 citizens and is based in the central part of Southern Jutland.
                Toftlund is known for being one of the smaller towns in Southern Jutland to elude the urbanisation and
                actually grow in population.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have always gone to school in Toftlund, even throughout gymnasium. The city is quite well-known for
                being one of the only places in Denmark where you
                can acquire an STX in just 2 years (instead of the usual 3).

                VIA is an institution for education with several campuses all over the central region of Denmark. VIA
                hosts several different programmes, due to the origin of VIA.
                VIA was created based on a merger of various smaller insitutions to form the larger and unified VIA
                University College.

                My three favorite things about VIA are:
            <ul id="via_list">
                <li>They had the perfect study programme for me</li>
                <br>
                <li>I heard very positive things before coming</li>
                <br>
                <li>I was informed that much of the study is group-based and hands-on</li>
            </ul>
